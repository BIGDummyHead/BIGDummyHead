### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is BIGDummyHead

I currently am majoring in Computer Science and working for a YouTuber!

Here are some of my favorite repos, that are completely open source!

- [Random Dog](https://github.com/BIGDummyHead/randomdog) - Random Dog pictures, a full wrapper on the site [Dog.Ceo](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/breeds-list)
- [Fast Loader](https://github.com/bigdummyhead/fastloader) - A DLL loader for a Unity game named Fast and Low!
- [Pointer Plus](https://github.com/BIGDummyHead/PointerPlus) - Makes C# kinda feel like C++!

Not in any particular order, but just a highlight!
